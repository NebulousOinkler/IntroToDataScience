# Intro To Data Science

This course introduces the core concepts of data science and machine learning, covering exploratory analysis, statistical modeling, and predictive algorithms. Students will gain hands-on experience with Python, key libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Pytorch), and real-world datasets. By the end, you’ll understand how to build, evaluate, and deploy basic machine learning and deep learning models for practical applications. No prior experience required—just a passion for data!
 
Key Topics: 

Data cleaning & visualization
Supervised vs. unsupervised learning
Regression, classification, clustering
Model evaluation & ethical considerations

 
Perfect for beginners looking to enter the field or professionals seeking a strong foundation. This course is free of charge and all skill levels welcome! 
 
⚠️ Note: Students must have access to a laptop or desktop with software installation privileges.

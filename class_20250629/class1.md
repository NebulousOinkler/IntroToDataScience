# Naive Bayes & Generative vs Discriminative Models

## What are Models?

**DEFINITION:** Models are representations of the real world using math and statistics, trained to find patterns or make predictions without explicit programming.

Example: Laws of Physics, GenAI, Linear Regression, Classification or Decision Trees

Models have some characteristic properties:

1. Abstraction of Reality

    - Simplify complex systems into rules or equations

2. Learns from Data

    - Uses algorithms to identify relationships between *inputs* and *outputs*

3. Generalization

    - A good model performs well on data that it has never seen before

    Ex. We can study many apples falling from a tree and deduce that F = ma for variables F, m, and a that we defined. However, this model becomes useful or good only when the same formula applies well to other apples we did not study. It gets more generalizable when we find that it applies to basketballs, or flowing water, or the motion of planets.

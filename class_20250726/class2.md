# Supervised Learning: Logistic Regressions (Incomplete)

## LG is the Discriminative Counterpart to Gaussian Naive Bayes

Last time, we discussed the Naive Bayes classifier and the difference between Generative and Discriminative Models. Recall that a generative model updates a prior distribution of labels given new data, leading to a modeled understanding of the core meaning of a class. A discriminative model, on the other hand, is intended to model how classes differ from one another given the existing training data at hand. Naive Bayes was a generative model - we required knowledge of the both our prior probabilities as well as our likelihoods. Today, we will adap

### Gaussian Assumption in Naive Bayes

-> Class Separation Boundary is Linear, Leads to a closed form for the P(y|x)

### Maximum Likelihood Estimation

### Gradient Descent

### Computing the Gradient and Hessian of Logistic Log-Likelihood

### Build Logistic Regression From Scratch
